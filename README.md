# TOVE 
### Tove Project:`http://www.eil.utoronto.ca/theory/enterprise-modelling/tove/`
The goal of the TOVE project is to develop a set of integrated ontologies for the modelling of both commercial and public enterprises. 

### Research work did in 2018 Summer:
The Urban OS Coordinator is an intelligent agent that is able to coordinate a set of activities, i.e., assign times, resources and costs to activities, such that all constraints are satisfied, e.g., temporal, resource, cost. The Coordinator is built on top of the TOVE ontologies for activities, states, resources, and cost.\
The goal of the TOVE project is to develop a set of integrated ontologies for the modelling of both commercial and public enterprises.
